[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/peterschussheim/oblique-strategies-client.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[Live demo](https://os.peterschussheim.com/)

## Overview

A simple React app that demonstrates a modal implemented using the recently introduced [`portals`]('https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html') API.

## Why

I wanted to share the ideas from the [Oblique Strategies]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies") deck of cards with others who might find it useful.  Additionally, it includes a simple `Modal` component using a feature of `React 16` that enables users to easily create portal components.

## Usage

- Build: `yarn run build` generates a fresh static build that can be deployed easily.
- Development: `yarn start` starts a local `webpack` development server.

## Notes

- For the sake of simplicity, the data is contained in a JSON file.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
